  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThe link transmission model is a macroscopic network
               traffic flow simulation tool based on Lighthill?Whitham?Richards
               theory. While its efficiency and accuracy are superior to the
               well-known cell transmission model, applications of its current
               numerical formulations are limited by the inability to apply
               changes to the fundamental diagrams of links within a simulation
               and the need to start the simulation with an empty network. We
               resolve both limitations by developing a methodology for
               initialising the discrete-time link model with a non-empty
               initial condition and for computing within-link densities during
               the simulation, which can then serve as an initial condition for
               continued simulation with a new fundamental diagram. Since the
               computation of within-link densities is algebraic, no new
               numerical errors are introduced. Optional support for multiple
               commodities, subcritical delays and platoon dispersion, are
               retained. The resulting model is demonstrated on a motorway
               corridor network with variable speed limits and dynamic lane
               management.",

  author    = "Daganzo, Carlos F",
  abstract  = "This paper presents a simple representation of traffic on a
               highway with a single entrance and exit. The representation can
               be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space,
               including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation,
               and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference
               equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be
               the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a
               special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The
               proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in
               density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call
               for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically
               seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations
               required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are
               thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can
               mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within
               moving queues.",

abstract = {A computationally efficient model predictive controller for congestion control in freeway networks is presented in this paper. The controller utilizes a modified Link-Node Cell Transmission Model (LN-CTM) to simulate traffic state trajectories under the effect of ramp metering, variable speed limit control and compute performance objectives. The modified LN-CTM simulates freeway traffic dynamics in the presence of capacity drop and ramp weaving effects. The objective of the controller can be chosen to represent commonly used congestion performance measures like total congestion delay measured in units of vehicle hours. The optimal control formulation based on this modified model is non-convex making it inefficient for direct use within a model predictive framework. Heuristic restrictions and relaxations are presented which allow the computation of the solution using optimal solutions of a sequence of derived linear programs. Mainly, the freeway is cleverly divided into regions, and limited restrictions are placed on solution trajectories to allow us to derive computationally efficient control actions. In the absence of capacity drop, this solution strategy provides optimal solutions to the original optimal control problem by solving a single linear program. The properties of the solution are discussed along with the role of variable speed limits when capacity drop is present/absent. Examples are provided to showcase the computational efficiency of the solution strategy, and scenarios simulated using the modified LN-CTM are analyzed to investigate the role of variable speed limits as a congestion control strategy.}

abstract = {Handling the microscopic level of Vehicle-Pedestrian interactions is highly useful for analyzing patterns-based pedestrian accident exposure. Recently proposed systems are based on vehicle-to-pedestrian communication to analyze real-time situations and thus warning both sides of potential crashes. Two parts are composing those systems. The first concerns network technologies ensuring direct communication between vehicles and pedestrians and the second is related to information processing analyzing and predicting trajectories and dangers. One of the most challenges facing the last systems category is to provide them with precise and sufficient data to test and improve them. Precisely, to analyze vehicle-pedestrian interactions, we suggest detecting pedestrian behavior with respect to its surrounding vehicles as well as detecting vehicle behavior with respect to its surrounding pedestrians. In this work, we consider generating pedestrians and vehicles’ data using SUMO. Moreover, we design a handler for preparing Vehicle-Pedestrian interactions data for upper layers for deep analytic and patterns finding purposes. Mixed realistic traffic simulation is performed in Mohammedia city and the first results are shown.}
